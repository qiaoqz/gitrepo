    //local branch must exist
    git pull/push

git push -u <remote> <local sub-branch>:<remote new branch>
// in this case, the name of <local sub-branch>could be different from that of <remote new branch>
// if it is the same, then maybe don't need the colon
//instead, maybe git push -u <the local branch that you want to push to remote>
// -u: set the upstream - need only pass -u once, it basically runs git branch --set-upstream-to
